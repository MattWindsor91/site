Hi there!  I'm Matt, a Research Assistant at Imperial College London.
I work with John Wickerson and Ally Donaldson on the _Interface Reasoning
for Interacting Systems project_, and my interests include:

- compiler testing;
- automated concurrency verification;
- generally, making programming (especially concurrent programming) safer.

In a past life, I was a PhD student at the University of York, working with
Mike Dodds and then Radu Calinescu.

# Pronouns

My pronouns are [he/him](http://my.pronoun.is/he) or
[they/them](http://my.pronoun.is/they), inasmuch as those are what I use when
referring to myself in third person.  While I don't personally mind which ones
people use when referring to me, I respect other people's pronouns: please
don't hesitate to correct me if I make mistakes.
