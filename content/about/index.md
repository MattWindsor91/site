Hi there!  I'm Matt, a Research Assistant at Imperial College London.
I work with John Wickerson and Ally Donaldson on the _Interface Reasoning
for Interacting Systems project_, and my interests include:

- compiler testing;
- automated concurrency verification;
- generally, making programming (especially concurrent programming) safer.
